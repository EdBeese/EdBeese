### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Edward Beesley (he/him), and I'm a London-based full-stack developer :uk:

I am a mid-level backend Rails developer, having worked in the industry since 2022.

I'm an alumni from Le Wagon :minibus: - having completed their 24-week part-time Web Development bootcamp in July 2022

I've developed skills in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript ES6, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap, SQL & ActiveRecord, git & GitHub and Heroku staging.

I develop primarily with BitBucket rather than GitHub, but am looking to expand my contributions to open source repos.
