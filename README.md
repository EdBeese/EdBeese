### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Edward Beesley (he/him), and I'm a London-based full-stack developer :uk:

I'm an alumni from Le Wagon :minibus: - having completed their 24-week part-time Web Development bootcamp in July 2022

I've developed skills in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript ES6, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap, SQL & ActiveRecord, git & GitHub and Heroku staging.

You can check out my bootcamp projects, including our final Rails web app - Fresh Pics, either through the repo or by visiting www.freshpics.me :movie_camera: - it's a great movie recommendation site that gives you succinct suggestions, based on what you're in the mood for and what streaming services you have access to.

I'm now furthering my skills in React and node.js, among others and looking to work on new projects!
